Cases of different possibilities of finding course numbers, titles, descriptions.

We have 25 or 50 or 100 URLs given as the input to the program.
Each webpage may be of different formats that will need different methods of recording the imp data like course number, title, description, pre-requisites.

Some possibilities:

A.The webpage contains all information: We can get all <p> tags
	1.If the webpage has the list of all courses, course numbers and course descriptions in <p> or Paragraph tag.
	2.If this information is in the form of tables where desc and name of courses are in <td> of tables.

B.The webpage has list of links to the courses:We have to look at many links and traverse through each for the desc.
	1.Finding the "CELL".. the smallest unit of HTML that has all the course details.
	2.The tags <li>, <tr> can be these cells.
	3.NOTE: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/ugrad/all-courses.shtml IS A CHALLENGE FOR FINDING THE CELL. <<--
C.Two cases for getting pre-requisites:
	1.If there is another separate section of course pre-requisites (generally included in the desc), then...
	2.Pre-requisites are encompassed in the course description... identifying and extracting those.
	
D.Extracting course title
	Either present in separate tags <b>...</b> or <u>...</u> or <i>...</i>
	or in separate lines... followed by a <br>
	
E.Extracting course numbers... (??)

F.Words to be eliminated:

	Stop Words-- a, the, of
	{research, projects, labs, lab, laboratories, seminar, college, precollege, university, class, periods, professor, undergrad, undergraduate, grad, graduate, studies}



Additional: -->Linear notion of courses... as in prereq courses appear and are registered before advanced courses which need them...
			-->Number of credits (??)
